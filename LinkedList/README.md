# Linked List
A linked list is a linear collection of data elements, in which linear order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence. Under the simplest form, each node is composed of data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration. 
## Complexities
### Time complexity

- Access: O(n)
- Search: O(n)
- Insertion: O(1)
- Deletion: O(n)
### Space complexity

O(n)

## Tests
We have a suite of unit tests that covers the major functionality of this data structure. To run this suite locally run `npm run test:linkedlist` from parent directory.
